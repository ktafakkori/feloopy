## Introduction

**FelooPy** (pronounced /fɛlupaɪ/) is an **integrated optimization environment** (IOE) designed for **decision optimization**. It involves the use of **automated operations research** (AutoOR) methods and techniques to identify **feasible solutions** that lead to **logical decisions** with the **optimal (best possible)** outcomes based on **given** or **learnable** policies. This Python library **simplifies** and **enhances** the use of **_existing_** and **_originally developed_** modeling, algorithm development, and analytical tools for decision-making within simulated **systems**, **industries**, and **supply chains**. FelooPy is an acronym alluding to an operations research scientist in pursuit of **fe**asible solutions, **lo**gical decisions, and **op**timal outcomes by optimization in **Py**thon. Additionally, it alludes to the concept of **loops** in computer programming and the **floppy disk**, symbolizing computing and memory efficiency. The development of FelooPy, which started in **September 2022**, continues under the **MIT license**.
