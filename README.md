| ![FelooPy Logo](miscellaneous/logo/logo1.png) | **FelooPy** (pronounced /fɛlupaɪ/) is a free and open-source Python library for automated operations research. It serves as both a hyper-optimization interface and an integrated optimization environment. The name "FelooPy" reflects the idea of suggesting practical solutions for various systems, industries, and supply chains. It emphasizes the importance of loops in programming and algorithm development, drawing similarities to the name "Floppy" to highlight memory efficiency. FelooPy helps operations research scientists achieve their goals with a range of models and tools. In simple words, FelooPy is a unified framework for optimization algorithms, decision-making methods, modeling, and analysis. |
| **News** | 🎉 Version 0.2.6 is out: Robustness and Stability! 🎉 |

### **Installation**

FelooPy can be installed on Linux-based distributions, Windows, or macOS. It has a few dependencies that should work on all these platforms.

FelooPy requires Python 3.10 or later to be installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, or if you have an older version, you can download it from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions. Alternatively, if you are using Anaconda, you can create a new environment with Python 3.10 or later and install FelooPy in that environment:

```
conda create --name feloopy python=3.10
conda activate feloopy
pip install feloopy
```

FelooPy (v0.2.6) has a few optional dependencies that can be installed using the following commands:

* All solvers: `pip install feloopy[all_solvers]`
* Gurobi: `pip install feloopy[gurobi]` [license help](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/12684663118993-How-do-I-obtain-a-Gurobi-license-#:~:text=You%20will%20need%20a%20license%20in%20order%20to,our%20website%2C%20unless%20it%20is%20a%20client%20license.)
* Cplex: `pip install feloopy[cplex]` [license help](https://mertbakir.gitlab.io/operations-research/how-to-install-cplex-ibm-academic-initiative/)
* Xpress: `pip install feloopy[xpress]` [license help](https://www.fico.com/en/fico-xpress-trial-and-licensing-options)
* Copt: `pip install feloopy[copt]` [license help](https://www.shanshu.ai/copt)
* Cylp: `pip install feloopy[cylp]` (might require [coin-or's optimization suite](https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OptimizationSuite/))
* Linux: `pip install feloopy[linux]` (support for some multi-objective optimization algorithms)

For multi-objective optimization, you should use the linux command for installation. However, please note that the optional dependencies for Linux kernel might not work on some operating systems. As a workaround, you can use a Conda-based Python 3.10 interpreter to ensure that optional dependencies for multi-objective optimization are installed correctly.
