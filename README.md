| ![FelooPy Logo](miscellaneous/logo/logo1.png) |  **FelooPy** (pronounced /fɛlupaɪ/) is a comprehensive Python library that automates operations research. It serves as a hyper-optimization interface and an integrated optimization environment. FelooPy offers practical solutions for various systems, industries, and supply chains, focusing on finding feasible solutions, logical decisions, and optimal outcomes using Python. The name is a nod to "loops" in programming and algorithm development and "floppy" disk in computing and memory efficiency. FelooPy helps operations research scientists achieve their goals by providing various models and algorithms. In summary, FelooPy is a comprehensive framework for single- and multi-criteria decision-making methods, mathematical modeling, optimization algorithms, and analytics. |
| **News** | 🎉 Version 0.2.7 is out: Comprehensivity! 🎉 |

### **Features ✨**

FelooPy requires Python 3.10 or later to be installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed or a Python interpreter with the necessary version, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions. Alternatively, if you are using an[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution, you can create a new environment with Python 3.10 or later and install FelooPy in that environment, as follows:

```
conda create --name your_environment python=3.10
conda activate your_environment
pip install feloopy
```

FelooPy (v0.2.7) has a few optional dependencies that can be installed using the following commands (recommended to install if possible):

For multi-objective optimization, you should use the linux command for installation. However, please note that the optional dependencies for Linux kernel might not work on some operating systems. As a workaround, you can use a Conda-based Python 3.10 interpreter to ensure that optional dependencies for multi-objective optimization are installed correctly.
