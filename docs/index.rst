Introduction
============

FelooPy
-------

Welcome to FelooPy (pronounced /f…õlupa…™/), a free and open-source Python library designed for automated operations research. FelooPy serves as a comprehensive hyper-optimization interface and a fully integrated optimization environment.

The name 'FelooPy' encapsulates our mission: to provide practical and applicable solutions for systems, industries, and supply chains. It echoes the importance of 'loops' in programming and algorithm development, drawing a playful parallel with the word 'Floppy' to highlight memory efficiency.

FelooPy is a powerful tool for operations research scientists. It combines various target, representor, and learner models with a unified framework of optimization algorithms, decision-making methods, and modeling and analytical tools. Simply put, FelooPy is your one-stop solution for all things optimization.
