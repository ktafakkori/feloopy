## FelooPy

FelooPy (pronounced /fɛlupaɪ/) is an integrated optimization environment (IOE) designed as a decision optimization hub. It involves the use of automated operations research (AutoOR) methods and techniques to identify feasible solutions that lead to logical decisions with the optimal (best possible) outcomes based on given or learnable policies. This Python library simplifies and enhances the use of existing and originally developed modeling, algorithm development, and analytical tools for decision-making within simulated systems, industries, and supply chains. FelooPy is an acronym alluding to an operations research scientist (a.k.a, decision scientist) in pursuit of feasible solutions, logical decisions, and optimal outcomes by optimization in Python. Additionally, it alludes to the concept of loops in computer programming and the floppy disk, symbolizing computing and memory efficiency. The development of FelooPy, which started in September 2022, continues under the MIT license.
